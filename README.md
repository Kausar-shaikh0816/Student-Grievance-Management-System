Student Grievance Support System – Project Description

The Student Grievance Support System is a web-based application developed to provide a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly platform for managing student grievances within an institution. The system digitalizes the entire grievance handling process, reducing manual work and improving communication between students and the administration.

In this project, I implemented two main user roles: Student and Admin, each with secure authentication and role-based access.

Student Module

Students can:

Register and log in securely to the system

Submit grievances by providing details such as grievance type, description, and department

View all their submitted grievances in a dashboard

Track the real-time status of grievances (Pending, In Progress, Resolved)

Check updates and responses provided by the admin

This module ensures that students can easily raise issues and monitor progress without repeatedly contacting the administration.

Admin Module

Admins can:

Log in through a secure admin panel

View all student grievances in a centralized dashboard

Filter and manage grievances based on status or department

Update grievance status and provide resolutions

Manage student records and monitor grievance statistics

The admin dashboard helps in efficiently handling grievances, ensuring accountability, and maintaining proper records.

Technology Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL

Server: XAMPP / Apache

Outcome

This system improves grievance resolution time, enhances transparency, and provides a structured workflow for both students and administrators. It is scalable and can be enhanced further with features like email notifications, role-based departments, and analytics.
